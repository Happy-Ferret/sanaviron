[ # Priority. (Difficulty) Task. Comment ]

1. (Easy) Rename translation domain from test to sanaviron.
2. (Easy) Remove bubble object to keep short and simple and because is screwy.
2. (Easy) Add check to show/hide menubar and statusbar.
3. (Easy - Larger) Synchronize object properties with entry widgets. Install each entry as observable and normalize
                   object and property names width observable name. Started.
4. (Heavy) To a class "Object" to transfer following functions from a class an "Arc":
	           set_gradient
	           set_color
	           set_color_rgba
	           set_fill_style
5. (Heavy) To add a widget of control of a gradient. In progress
6. (Hard) Storage of gradients to assign property gradients in class Canvas.
7. (Middle) Include README, COPYING, help and other data files and exclude sanaviron/src.
8. (Middle) Add support for py2exe and Windows installer like Inno Setup Compiler or Bitrock.
9. (Middle) Add support for documentation like (doxygen, ...). Requires additional research.

Use servant design pattern: Putting the things in their places.

1. (Middle) Move movable and resizable related code from canvas to object. Transformable code already moved.
2. (Hard) Split object in interfaces: movable, resizable. Transformable is not necessary, yet.
3. (Easy) Implement these interfaces in object and clean object class.
4. (Hard) Research if draweable interface can replace object-parent method.
